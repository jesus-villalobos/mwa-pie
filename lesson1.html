            <h2>Python Terminal:</h2>
            Use this terminal to test the code below, and to experiment with the things in this lesson!
            <b>IT MAY TAKE A MOMENT TO POP UP AND BE READY FOR USE</b>
            <br>
            To open the Python terminal:
            <ul>
                <li>Click the 'Shell' tab below</li>
                <li>Type 'python3' (without the quotes) into the first line</li>
                <li>Run code!</li>
            </ul>
            <b>NOTE:</b> Code will not auto-indent in the Python terminal, so you will have to use "tab" to indent
            lines that need indentation.
            <br>
            <b>NOTE:</b> If the terminal does not let you keep typing in the, refresh the page and try again.

            <h2>Lesson Content:</h2>

            <h3>Types:</h3>

            In Python, "types" are names that refer to certain kinds of things within the language. For the purposes of these
            lessons, we will focus on two types:
            <ul>
                <li>Text Types</li>
                <li>Numeric Types</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Text Types:</h3>
            The Text Type is encapsulated by the <b>string</b>. Strings are they way that Python developers use plain words within
            code. Strings carry meaning within them, and are used to interface with the user. A string is text that is found within
            either single OR double quotes; it does not matter, as long as either side of a string has the same kind. Strings
            also have some special functions associated with them:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    To ask Python if something is a string, you can input it into the special
                    <b style="color: blue;">type()</b> method.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To convert something to a string, you can use the special <b style="color: blue;">str()</b> method.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Try these things in the terminal above!!
            <p>
                <b>NOTE:</b> A comment is NOT considered a string. A comment is used only in the script of code, but is never run
                by the terminal. Comments are identified by one pound symbol, #, or wrapped in triple quotes, """.
            </p>
            <pre>
# This is a comment. It will not be run.
# Neither will this one. The symbol comments out one line at a time.

"""This is also a comment"""
"""A pound in here, #, does not matter because it is already commented out."""

"This is a string."
'So is this.'
# ---> Either double or single quotes work.

"A pound in here, #, does nothing because it is being interpreted as plain English."

>>> str(3)
'3'
>>> str(909230934)
'909230934'
>>> type("Hello World")
< class 'str'>           --> 'str' stands for 'string'</pre>

            <h3>Numeric Types:</h3>
            There are two different kinds of numbers that fall into the numeric type:
            <ul>
                <li>Integer, int</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The int is any whole number.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Floating Point Number, float</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The float is ANY number with a decimal point, no matter how many digits come after it.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            Python uses instances of the numeric type to perform math calculations, and carry meaning between different
            parts of programs. ints and floats can be used simultaneously in math operations, but there are certain points
            where it becomes useful to use one kind or the other.

            <p>
                You can use special instances of Python functions to convert between either type. These are the <b>int()</b>
                and <b>float()</b> functions.
            </p>

            Numbers also have some special functions associated with them:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    To ask Python if something is a number (float or int), you can input it into the special
                    <b style="color: blue;">type()</b> method.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To convert a number to a float or int, you can use the special <b style="color: blue;">float()</b> or
                    <b style="color: blue;">int()</b> methods, respectively.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Try these things in the terminal above!!

            <pre>
# NOTE: the three arrows represent Python input, and the line after it is the output.

>>> type(39.07)
< class 'float'>
>>> type(9839483)
< class 'int'>

"""To convert between either type:"""

>>> float(76)  # int --> float
76.0
>>> float(4)   # int --> float
4.0

>>> int(36.97)    # float --> int
36
>>> int(3.141592658597373982308940934)     # float --> int
3</pre>

            <h3>Python Math Operators:</h3>
            In Python, we use the same ol' math operations used in everyday math, plus 3 addition functions. The full list
            of operations, and their symbol is:
            <ul>
                <li>Addition, +</li>
                <li>Subtraction, -</li>
                <li>Multiplication, *</li>
                <li>Division, /</li>
                <li>Power, **</li>
                <li>Floor Division, //</li>
                <li>Modulus, %</li>
                <li>Equality, ==</li>
            </ul>
            The three new operations are <b>Floor Division</b>, <b>Modulus</b>, and <b>Equality</b>. Here is a description
            of each, along with a few examples.

            <p>
                <b>Floor Division, //</b> is the same as regular division, it simply cuts off everything after the decimal point
                if there is anything.
                <br>
                <b>Modulus, %</b> returns the remainder of division. You can think about it as "lazy division" because it
                ignores performing long division into decimal places, and just spits out the remainder.
                <br>
                <b>Equality, ==</b> returns whether two things are equal to each other. The output will always be either
                <i>True</i> or <i>False</i>.
            </p>
            <pre>
"""Familiar Operations:"""
>>> 2 + 3
5
>>> 2 - 3
-1
>>> 2 * 3
6
>>> 6 / 3
2.0
>>> 3 ** 2
9

"""New Operations:"""
>>> 6 // 3
2
>>> 13 // 3      --> 13 / 3 = 4.33333333
4
>>> 13 % 3       --> 13 / 3 = 4 with remainder 1
1
>>> 15 % 4       --> 15 / 4 = 3 with remainder 3
3
>>> 3 == 3.0     --> The type doesn't matter; they are equal regardless
True
>>> 567 == 36    --> They are obviously not equal
False</pre>
